title: Introducing World Model
---

The world model originated from
[Ha and Schmidhuber, 2018b; Matsuo et al., 2022](https://qubitpi.github.io/worldmodels.github.io/). Basically, human
develop a mental model of the world based on what we are able to perceive with our limited senses. The decisions and
actions we make are based on this internal model. The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just
a _model_. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. We have only selected **concepts, and
relationships** between them, and uses those to represent the real system.

:::tip What is a World Model?

With respect to [llm-reasoners](https://github.com/QubitPi/llm-reasoners), a **world model** is a _repurposed LLM_,
which builds a reasoning graph. In this graph, a node is called a **state** and a link is called an **action**. _The LLM
generates the link_

### Language Model as World Model

In general, a world model predicts the next state of the reasoning after applying an action to the current state.
[RAP](https://github.com/QubitPi/RAP) enables us to instantiate the general concepts of state and action in different
ways depending on the specific reasoning problems at hand.
